## typed-vuex
> **⚠ TypeScript 4.1 needed**
>
> This package makes heavy use of TypeScript 4.1 features like [Key Remapping](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#key-remapping-mapped-types) and [Template Literal Types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#template-literal-types), so you won't be able to use it with TypeScript version under 4.1

Also this package contains only type definitions, so it won't affect your javascript code in any way.

### Usage

Only type alias can be used configuring module. If you want to pass interfaces into `ModuleConfig` generic, you can pass it into `ConvertToAlias` helper.

```ts
type AuthActions = {
  authorize: () => void
}

interface IAuthMutations {
  setIsAuthed: (isAuthed: boolean) => void;
}

interface IAuthModuleState {
  isAuthed: boolean;
}

export type AuthModuleConfig = ModuleConfig<
true,
// Usage of interface for State is ok
IAuthModuleState,
never,
// Usage of type alias for mutations/getters/actions is ok
AuthActions,
// To use interface for mutations/getters/actions, you need to convert it into type alias
ConvertToAlias<IAuthMutations>,
{ account: AuthAccountModuleConfig }
>;
```
